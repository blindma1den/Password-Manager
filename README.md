Password-Manager



The project is a basic password manager developed in Python. It allows users to store, retrieve, and delete passwords for various websites or services. Passwords are encrypted before being saved to a file to ensure their security. For educational purposes only. 

This script  uses the cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt passwords, and generates an encryption key that is stored in a file called "key.key." Users can access the password manager through a command-line menu of options, making it easier to manage their passwords more securely. Please note that this is a simplified and educational version, and there are professional and more secure password managers available in the market for real-world use. You can customize as you need! 

Happy hacking! :)
